## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Arduino Won't Upload
```
Symptom: "data section exceeds available space"
Cause: Using old unoptimized code
Solution:
  [ ] Verify file: traffic_light_control.ino (optimized version)
  [ ] Check for "char inputBuffer[32]" (not "String inputString")
  [ ] Re-download from correct location
  [ ] Try again
```

### Issue: Bridge Server Won't Connect
```
Symptom: "No Arduino found"
Cause: Serial port not available
Solution:
  [ ] Check USB cable connected
  [ ] Close Arduino IDE Serial Monitor
  [ ] Check Device Manager (Windows) or ls /dev/tty* (Mac/Linux)
  [ ] Verify correct COM port
  [ ] Restart bridge server
  [ ] Try manual connection: curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/connect
```

### Issue: WebSocket Not Connecting
```
Symptom: Red dot in UI, no updates
Cause: Bridge server WebSocket not running
Solution:
  [ ] Verify bridge server running
  [ ] Check port 3002 not in use
  [ ] Check browser console for WebSocket errors
  [ ] Restart bridge server
  [ ] Refresh browser
```

### Issue: Timer Not Counting
```
Symptom: Timer shows but doesn't decrease
Cause: WebSocket not receiving updates
Solution:
  [ ] Check green dot (connection indicator)
  [ ] Verify Arduino in AUTO mode
  [ ] Check bridge server console for STATUS responses
  [ ] Send STATUS command manually
  [ ] Restart Arduino (STOP then AUTO)
```

### Issue: Configuration Not Applying
```
Symptom: Settings don't change Arduino behavior
Cause: Commands not reaching Arduino
Solution:
  [ ] Check bridge server console for command echo
  [ ] Verify Arduino in correct mode
  [ ] Send commands manually via Serial Monitor
  [ ] Check for error messages
  [ ] Restart system (Arduino, bridge, React)
```
