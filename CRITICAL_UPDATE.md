# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX - Must Re-Upload Arduino Code!

## What Was Wrong

Your React UI's "Apply All Changes" button wasn't actually changing anything on the Arduino because:

1. **Arduino had hardcoded timing:** Green=5s, Yellow=2s (always)
2. **Arduino had hardcoded sequence:** NS→EW→R3→R4 (always)
3. **No commands existed** to change these settings

## What's Fixed Now

✅ Arduino now accepts configuration commands  
✅ React sends actual configuration when you click "Apply All Changes"  
✅ Timing is fully configurable (15-60s green, 3-8s yellow)  
✅ Sequence is fully configurable (any order you want)  

---

## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED

### STEP 1: Re-Upload Arduino Code (MANDATORY!)

```
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. File → Open → arduino/traffic_light_control/traffic_light_control.ino
3. Tools → Port → Select your Arduino COM port
4. Click Upload button (→)
5. Wait for "Upload complete"
6. Close Serial Monitor
```

**Without this step, the configuration features will NOT work!**

### STEP 2: Restart Bridge Server

```powershell
# Press Ctrl+C to stop current server
cd arduino-bridge
node server.js

# Should see: ✅ Arduino connected successfully!
```

### STEP 3: Test It!

```powershell
# Open browser
http://localhost:5173/camera/1

# Go to Traffic Lights tab

# Change sequence:
Click ↓ on "East" to move it down

# Change timing:
Green: 20 seconds
Yellow: 4 seconds

# Click "Apply All Changes"

# Open fullscreen → Traffic Lights tab
# Lights now cycle in YOUR order with YOUR timing!
```

## 🆕 New Arduino Commands

```arduino
SET_GREEN:30        // Set green duration (15-60 seconds)
SET_YELLOW:5        // Set yellow duration (3-8 seconds)
SET_SEQUENCE:1,0,2,3   // Set sequence order (0=NS,1=EW,2=R3,3=R4)
```

### Test Commands Directly

```powershell
# Set green to 20 seconds
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:3001/api/command -Method Post -Body '{"command":"SET_GREEN:20"}' -ContentType "application/json"

# Set sequence to EW→NS→R3→R4
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:3001/api/command -Method Post -Body '{"command":"SET_SEQUENCE:1,0,2,3"}' -ContentType "application/json"

# Start AUTO mode
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:3001/api/mode/AUTO -Method Post
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (Hardcoded):
```cpp
if (elapsed > 5000) {  // Always 5 seconds green
  autoPhase = 1;
}

// Always NS → EW → R3 → R4
case 0: // NS Green
case 2: // EW Green  
case 4: // R3 Green
case 6: // R4 Green
```

### After (Configurable):
```cpp
if (elapsed > greenDuration) {  // Your configured duration!
  autoPhase++;
}

// Uses sequence[] array:
int currentRoad = sequence[roadIndex];  // Your configured order!
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Verification

After re-uploading Arduino code:

1. Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud)
2. Type: `HELP`
3. Press Enter
4. You should see:
   ```
   Timing Configuration:
   SET_GREEN:30   - Set green duration (15-60 seconds)
   SET_YELLOW:5   - Set yellow duration (3-8 seconds)
   
   Sequence Configuration:
   SET_SEQUENCE:0,1,2,3  - Set road sequence
   ```

If you see these lines, the new code is loaded! ✅

If you DON'T see these lines, the old code is still running! ❌ Upload again!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Still not working after upload"

1. **Verify upload succeeded:** Check Arduino IDE says "Upload complete"
2. **Close Serial Monitor:** It blocks the bridge server
3. **Restart bridge server:** Stop with Ctrl+C, then `node server.js`
4. **Clear browser cache:** Hard refresh with Ctrl+F5
5. **Check Serial Monitor:** Type `HELP` to verify new commands exist

### "Error: Green duration must be 15-60 seconds"

This is GOOD! It means the new code is running and enforcing valid ranges.

### "Unknown command: SET_GREEN"

This means OLD code is still running. Re-upload Arduino code!

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

- ✅ Serial Monitor shows new HELP commands
- ✅ Arduino responds to `SET_GREEN:20` command
- ✅ React "Apply All Changes" triggers configuration
- ✅ Fullscreen timer shows YOUR duration (not always 5s)
- ✅ Lights cycle in YOUR sequence (not always NS→EW→R3→R4)
