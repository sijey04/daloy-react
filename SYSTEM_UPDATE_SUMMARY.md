## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Upload Arduino Code ⚡
```
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. File → Open → arduino/traffic_light_control/traffic_light_control.ino
3. Tools → Board → Arduino Uno
4. Tools → Port → (Select your Arduino COM port)
5. Click Verify (✓) - should show <100% RAM
6. Click Upload (→)
7. Wait for "Done uploading"
```

### Step 2: Start System 🚀
```powershell
# Option A: Use quick start script
.\start-updated-system.ps1

# Option B: Manual start
# Terminal 1: Bridge Server
cd arduino-bridge
node server.js

# Terminal 2: React App
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test Everything ✅
```
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Click any intersection
3. Click fullscreen icon on camera feed
4. Check Traffic Lights tab → should show real-time updates
5. Look for green pulsing dot → indicates WebSocket connected
6. Watch timer count down
7. Test configuration changes
```

- WebSocket broadcasts status changes

✅ **Configuration Features**
- Change green/yellow timing (15-60s, 3-8s)
- Reorder signal sequence
- Apply changes to Arduino
- All changes work instantly

✅ **Manual Controls**
- Set specific lights (NS_GREEN, EW_RED, etc.)
- Emergency stop (ALL_RED)
- Test mode (TEST)
- AUTO mode with custom timing

✅ **Arduino Commands**
- AUTO - Start automatic sequence
- STOP - Stop and all red
- TEST - Test all LEDs
- STATUS - Get current status
- SET_GREEN:X - Set green duration
- SET_YELLOW:X - Set yellow duration
- SET_SEQUENCE:A,B,C,D - Set sequence order

✅ **User Interface**
- Fullscreen modal with camera feeds
- Split-screen view (2 cameras side-by-side)
- PTZ controls (pan/tilt/zoom)
- Traffic light settings panel
- Connection status indicator
- Timer with automatic reset

## Testing Checklist

### Arduino
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] RAM usage shows <100% (should be ~85%)
- [ ] Uploads successfully to Arduino Uno
- [ ] Serial monitor shows commands (9600 baud)
- [ ] LEDs respond to commands

### Bridge Server
- [ ] Server starts on port 3001
- [ ] WebSocket starts on port 3002
- [ ] Connects to Arduino automatically
- [ ] STATUS command returns data
- [ ] Broadcasts updates to clients

### React Frontend
- [ ] App loads without errors
- [ ] Intersection detail page opens
- [ ] Fullscreen modal works
- [ ] Green dot shows connection status
- [ ] Timer counts down smoothly
- [ ] Traffic lights update in real-time

### Integration
- [ ] Configuration changes apply to Arduino
- [ ] Manual controls work from UI
- [ ] AUTO mode cycles with custom timing
- [ ] Sequence order changes work
- [ ] WebSocket reconnects if disconnected

---

## Expected Behavior

### Normal Operation:
```
1. Arduino runs AUTO mode with default timing (5s green, 2s yellow)
2. Bridge server polls STATUS every 2 seconds
3. Arduino responds: "NS: G EW: R R3: R R4: R"
4. Bridge converts to: {northSouth: "GREEN", eastWest: "RED", ...}
5. WebSocket broadcasts JSON to React
6. React updates UI with current states
7. Timer counts down based on state changes
8. Cycle repeats automatically
```

### Configuration Change:
```
1. User sets Green: 30s, Yellow: 5s, Sequence: 1,0,3,2
2. React sends to bridge: /api/command with SET_GREEN:30
3. Bridge sends to Arduino: "SET_GREEN:30\n"
4. Arduino confirms: "Green: 30s"
5. Repeat for yellow and sequence
6. React starts AUTO mode
7. Arduino cycles with new configuration
8. UI updates in real-time
```

## Troubleshooting

### Arduino Won't Upload
```
❌ Problem: "data section exceeds available space"
✅ Solution: Make sure you're using the OPTIMIZED code from 
           arduino/traffic_light_control/traffic_light_control.ino
```

### Bridge Server Can't Find Arduino
```
❌ Problem: "No Arduino found"
✅ Solution: 
   1. Check USB cable connection
   2. Close Arduino IDE Serial Monitor
   3. Check Device Manager for COM port
   4. Restart bridge server
```

### WebSocket Not Connecting
```
❌ Problem: Red dot in UI, no real-time updates
✅ Solution:
   1. Verify bridge server running on port 3002
   2. Check browser console for errors
   3. Restart bridge server
   4. Refresh browser
```

### Timer Not Counting
```
❌ Problem: Timer stuck, not decreasing
✅ Solution:
   1. Check WebSocket connected (green dot)
   2. Verify Arduino in AUTO mode
   3. Check bridge server console for STATUS responses
   4. Restart Arduino (send STOP then AUTO)
```
